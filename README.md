# HG Blogs ðŸ“š
I developed a blog website using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS. The project combines a user-friendly interface with powerful backend features, creating an engaging platform for readers and content creators alike.

## Key Features:
User Authentication (Sign In/Sign Up): The website allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. With user authentication built in, readers can access personalized content and manage their subscriptions easily.

#### Subscription for Updates:
Users can subscribe to receive notifications about the latest blog posts, ensuring they never miss new content. The subscription system is integrated with email notifications, giving readers a seamless experience.

#### Commenting on Posts:
Readers can leave comments on individual blog posts, encouraging interaction and feedback. This feature helps create a community around the blog and fosters discussion around various topics.

Content Management with Sanity CMS: The website leverages Sanity CMS, a headless content management system, to provide a flexible and scalable backend. This allows content creators to easily add, update, or delete blog posts, managing everything from a simple, user-friendly interface.

### Technical Highlights:
Next.js: The website is built on Next.js, enabling server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO. The framework also supports automatic code splitting and fast refresh for a smooth development experience.

#### Tailwind CSS: 
For styling, I used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid prototyping and custom designs. The website features a modern, clean, and responsive design, making it accessible and visually appealing across all devices.

#### Sanity CMS: 
I integrated Sanity CMS as the content management system, allowing for easy, flexible management of the blog's content. This CMS allows real-time editing, version control, and scalability, making it a perfect fit for a growing blog.

#### Performance and User Experience:
The blog website is designed with performance in mind. By utilizing Next.js, I ensured that the website loads quickly, with fast server-side rendering and optimized image handling. The design is responsive, meaning it looks great on all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. The user interface is clean and intuitive, providing an enjoyable browsing experience for visitors.

#### Why This Project?
This project serves as both a practical application and a showcase of my web development skills. It combines modern technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS to create a fully functional and scalable blog platform. I wanted to build a blog that not only provides a pleasant reading experience but also allows content creators to manage their posts effortlessly.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
